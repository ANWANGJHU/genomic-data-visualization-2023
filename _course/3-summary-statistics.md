# Lecture 3

## 3.0 Lesson learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should understand sources of quality variability in spatially resolved transcriptomics data, how to evaluate the quality of spatially resolved transcriptomic data and use data visualizations to assist us in this assessment. 

## 3.1 Why summarize?

## 3.1.1 Types of summary statistics

- Sum (total)
- Mean (average)
- Spread (variance)
- Dependence (pairwise correlations)

## 3.2 Quality Control 

- Total number of genes per cell
- Unique number of gene species per cell
- Total number of cells expressing a gene

## 3.3 Normalizing

# Hands-on component 3

Our in-class hands-on component will involve analyzing our spatial transcriptomics datasets to create a data visualization to evaluate the data quality. We will also do an in-class demonstration of the homework submission process.

# Homework 3

Learn from your classmates: pick someone else's data visualization for a spatial transcriptomics dataset that is different from your own. Apply their code to your spatial transcriptomics dataset. Write a description of how this data visualization makes salient similar or different features from the data visualization you made.
