1. Which data visualization are you critiquing?

2. Do you think the author was effective in making salient the point they said they wanted to make? Why or why not?

The intended goal of the visualization was to demonstrate how "the saliency of the data clusters is impacted by the choice of how many PCA components are included." I think the author does a good job in visualizing this as its clear to see that the t-SNE plots generated on 20 principal components have gene expression and detection of the two genes more tightly clustered.  

3. How could you improve the data visualization in making salient the point they said they wanted to make?

The only things I would suggest would be to replace the second gene with a gene that has gene expression pattern different than the first one so you could visualize the overall clustering better. Also, this wouldn't have a huge impact on saliency since it's clear already, but maybe separating the color bar somehow to differentiate between the gene expression and detection color scale to make that element clearer.
