1. Which data visualization are you critiquing?

2. Do you think the author was effective in making salient the point they said they wanted to make? Why or why not?

I agree that Gwen was effective in making salient her exploration about the effects of scaling on identifying cell clusters in the dataset.
She has clear titles accompanying each plot that describes the particular experiment. She also has used the visualization channel of a contiuous color gradient 
to visualize the amount of geen expression, accompanied by a descriptive legend. 
I also like how she emphasizes oen panel by placing it into a more prominent position with bigger panel size.


** side friendly comment don't take me wrong : this is just my curious note about how Gwen could visualize tSNE in terms of cell clusters so I ran part of the code (since I already have a tSNE on scaled info in my environment)
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(df1,aes(x=X1,y=X2,col = relative_gene_expression)) + geom_point(size = 0.2) + scale_color_gradientn(colors = c(“lightgrey”, “yellow”, “orange”, “red”)) + ggtitle(“Clustered Total Gene Expression of Cells Expressing ERBB2 \n(Not Scaled)”) + theme_classic() + labs(color = “Gene Expression \nof ERBB2”)
```
I am still seeing the classic classic tSNE as we did in class, so I am confused how i could make the cluster plot like that. 


3. How could you improve the data visualization in making salient the point they said they wanted to make?

I would suggest Gwen add a title for the whole figure to describe what her goal of the visualization is (just summarizes what she describes in the text).

Furthermore(another side comment), maybe could set the seed to a fixed number for reproducibility and to make sure that all three visualizations 
are done under a same ~randomness 

** side comment: for aesthetics, maybe can truncate the axis so hat there would not be as big margins.
