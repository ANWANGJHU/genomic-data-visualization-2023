I am critiquing Rebecca's visualization available in https://jef.works/genomic-data-visualization-2023/blog/2023/01/27/rdemelo1/

The author aims to make salient the relationship between the expression levels of selected genes and the cell area. I believe the visualization is effective because for gene PDGFRA and PDGFRB, we can observe an inverse relationship between the gene expression and the cell area. In particular, if a cell has high expression levels of the selected gene, it tends to have a relatively small cell area. This is a very interesting finding. 

To further improve this visualization, I would suggest the following two changes.

1. Since the objective of this visualization is to elucidate the relationship between gene expression and cell area, I suggest the author can consider not encoding cell's location information via other visual channels. The spatial information of the cell is less relevant with the goal of this visualization.

2. The visual clarity of the plot can be further enhanced with smaller and more transparent dots.

Overall, this is a very insightful visualization and can be made even better with less irrelevant information and clearer visual effects.
