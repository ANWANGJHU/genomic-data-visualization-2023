I am critiquing Rafael's work https://jef.works/genomic-data-visualization-2023/blog/2023/01/27/rpeixot1/ . In this data visualization, the author plots the spatial location of each cell (using the geometric primintive of points) and highlight those cells with at most three genes expressed (via the visual channel of color). I think the data visualization. The author aims to make salient the relationship between spatial location of cells and the number of genes they expressed, espectially those with few number of genes expressed. I think the data visualization was effective. From the plot, audience can observe clearly that the cells with at most three genes expressed mainly concentrate on the bottom right part of panel. The choice of color also indicates the target category saliently. The only suboptimal design is the order at which the author plot the points. There are very few black dots are hiding behind the blue dots. To further improve this data visualization, the author can plot the cells with at most three genes expressed first and then plot the rest of them. In this way, all the black dots will be on top. In summary, this is a great data visualization.
