1. Which data visualization are you critiquing?

2. Do you think the author was effective in making salient the point they said they wanted to make? Why or why not?

The intended goal of the visualization was stated as: "make salient the spatial distribution of the expression of the gene ERBB2 using a 2D tSNE plot based on gene expression similarity." 
I originally read that statement as the author meaning that they hoped to visualize spatial distribution as in the original x and y values of the cells and then plot the gene expression of ERBB2. However, this wouldn't make sense as the x and y values of the points were generated using t-SNE based on the gene expression data. 
Beacuse of this I then interpreted the statement as the author hoping to make salient the gene expression of ERBB2 when the cells are clustered based on similar gene expression using t-SNE. Based on that statement, I think the visualization does a job of hammering home the point as the ERBB2-generated color is fairly homogenous in each of the clusters indicating that ERBB2 was pretty important in the differentiation of cell types in the t-SNE method. The only issue I had was the points were a little big which caused some overlap that made the trends a little bit harder to see right away. 

3. How could you improve the data visualization in making salient the point they said they wanted to make?

In order to improve this data visualization I would make the points just a little smaller so there would be slightly less overlap. Also I think the visualization could be improved by stating what data the t-SNE is being generated on so the viewer can better understand what the clusters mean.
