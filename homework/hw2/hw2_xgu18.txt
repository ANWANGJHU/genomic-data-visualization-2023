1. Which data visualization are you critiquing?

2. Do you think the author was effective in making salient the point they said they wanted to make? Why or why not?

After reading the description, I do think the author was effective in making salient the spatial pattern of GATA3 expression.
The author used a saturation gradient from colorless (white) to fully saturated red to represent little to no expression (0) and most signifiant expression levels.
It is also nice that the author outlined the boundary to each cell:) 

However, it probably would help if the author could specify what the numbers on the legend bar mean in the description - for example, without the descriptions, it would be hard for one to realize whethter 0 and 40 
refers to "raw counts" of signal intensity, or if it just an author-defined score for gene expression.
Probably irrelavant - the description could be a bit extrapolating (per "any spatial pattern" and cells "belong to a certain cell type))

3. How could you improve the data visualization in making salient the point they said they wanted to make?

I do not have much comment on the usage of visual channels or Gestalt principle - the gist of the visualization is straightforward and elegant.
(1) I will probably add a graph title to make sure the meaning is clearly conveyed
(2) As the goal is for "spatial pattern" - it is actually quite interesting to see if the original data really looks like this - there are no cells with a y_centroid position below 2000.
Hence, I would adjust the y-axis to be the same scale and same starting range (from 0 instead of from 2000) with the x-axis (debatable!)
