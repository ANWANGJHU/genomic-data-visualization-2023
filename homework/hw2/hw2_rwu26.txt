1. Which data visualization are you critiquing?

2. Do you think the author was effective in making salient the point they said they wanted to make? Why or why not?

The author intended to make more salient the relationship between EPCAM expression within the cell and the area of the cell, and how this relationship is independent of the x position of the centroid.
The author encoded the spatial data of x centroid and cell area with the visual channel of position along the axes, with visual channel of saturation to demonstrate the gene expression of EPCAM within each cell.
It was clear to see that EPCAM expression is independent of x centroid, but it's not obvious to observe the relationship between EPCAM expression and cell area. 
The dotted line to separate high expression and low expression region seemed to be chosen by observation, and I think there would be better ways to enhance the saliency.

3. How could you improve the data visualization in making salient the point they said they wanted to make?

I would use position along the x axis as the visual channel for to encode cell area, and use position along the y axis to encode EPCAM expression. 
In the meantime, I will use the visual channel of saturation to encode x centroid. 
I will also add a linear regression line between EPCAM expression and cell area with 95% confidence interval to show the saliency of correlation.
