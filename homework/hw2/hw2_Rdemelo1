1. Which data visualization are you critiquing?

2. Do you think the author was effective in making salient the point they said they wanted to make? Why or why not?

The author used explanatory data visualization to make the spatial differences in expression of gene AGR3 in various cells salient.
Using geometric primitive of points and lines, and visual channel of size and position along z-axis, he was able to clearly show the concentration
sites of the gene. His usage of saturation as a visual channel allows the detection of clear highest expression points along the 3D axis. 
Overall, I believe the representation to be clear and well-designed.

3. How could you improve the data visualization in making salient the point they said they wanted to make?

I would implement ranges to limit the number of points being plotted, but keeping the visual channels chosen by the author.
