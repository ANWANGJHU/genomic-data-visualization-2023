## What data types are you visualizing?
I am visualizing the categorical data of the presence of 3 or fewer genes in a cell together with the spatial data of the (x, y) coordinates of these same cells.

## What data encodings are you using to visualize these data types?
I am using the geometric primitive of a point to represent the cells. To encode the categorical data (low gene count), I am using the visual channel of color. To encode the spatial data (coordinates), I am using the visual channel of position.

## What type of data visualization is this? What about the data are you trying to make salient through this data visualization? 
My visualization tries to identify if there is a specific region of the tissue where the cells expressed fewer genes.

## What Gestalt principles or knowledge about perceptiveness of visual encodings are you using to accomplish this?
I am using the Gestalt principle of similarity and proximity to represent the low gene count cells as a group. The gestalt principle of proximity was also used to put the legends on the side.

## Code

```{r}
data <- read.csv('data/pikachu.csv.gz')

metadata <- data[, 1:4]
gexp <- data[5:ncol(data)]

library(tidyverse)

metadata %>%
    mutate(count = rowSums(gexp)) %>%
    mutate(low_count_cells = ((count <= 3))) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(x=x_centroid, y=y_centroid, color=low_count_cells),
               size=.8) +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("#ABCFED", "#000000")) +
    labs(title = "Spatial position of cells with low gene count",
         subtitle = "Cells with 3 or less genes expressed",
         x = "x centroid", y = "y centroid",
         color = "Low count cells")
```
